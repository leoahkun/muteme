# Mute Me

Mute Me is a Python script which monitors you through your webcam and mute your microphone with natural gestures. Most people will cover their mouth when coughing, sneezing, burping or yawning. In todays world where many are working from home and there are constant online meetings, actively managing when to mute and unmute has become a chore. Mute Me tries to solve this problem.

The code is based on Boris Maysel's implementation [here](https://github.com/borismay/dont_touch_your_face)
